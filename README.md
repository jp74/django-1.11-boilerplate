Get started quick.

* Clone this repo;
* Make sure the interpreter specified in `runtime.txt` is the one you want.  (Also make sure it's installed, `which $(cat runtime.txt)`);
* Run `./setup.sh database_name`;
* Run `workon ${PWD##*/}`.  This is in the setup script but doesn't persist outside it for some reason.
